# Wireless Frog 3

![Paycer Wireless Frog Update](../.gitbook/assets/Update\_03.jpg)

### Achievements



The main topics the Paycer team is working on at the moment are:

* Banking Partnership
* Legal Matters
* Exchange Listings
* Infrastructure Partnerships
* Paycer.Finance Development (DeFi)
* Paycer Platform Development (CeDeFi)
* Paycer Company Related Topics
* Marketing

During the "Wireless Frog" sprint we were able to finish some important development topics but also onboarded 3 new Paycer team members that will help to increase the progress even further. We also decided that it makes more sense to only show the tickets that have been fully finished during the sprint. One of the biggest achievements during the sprint was the MEXC listing. We also made good progress regarding legal matters. A few private tickets were excluded from the export. Please find the update below.
